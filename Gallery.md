It looks like there are no entries to the gallery yet. Do you have any custom validations of your own? Be the first one to submit!

## How to submit a custom validation?

Please create a gist with the custom validation and provide documentation of it by using comments on that file or even better, provide a secondary file as a `README.md` so you can better document it.

Then create a PR adding it to this file providing a `### Title`, link to the gist and small description so it's easier to know at a glace what it is about without having to open the gist.
