**IMPORTANT:** replace all the instances of "rootstrap/validate" with the actual library name or remove if doesn't apply

## Got a question or problem?

Please, do not open issues for the general support questions as we want to keep GitHub issues for bug reports and feature requests. You've got much better chances of getting your question answered on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/validate) where maintainers are looking at questions tagged with `rootstrap-validate`.

StackOverflow is a much better place to ask questions since:

- there are hundreds of people willing to help on StackOverflow
- questions and answers stay available for public viewing so your question / answer might help someone else
- SO voting system assures that the best answers are prominently visible.

To save your and our time we will be systematically closing all the issues that are requests for general support and redirecting people to StackOverflow.

## You think you've found a bug?

Oh, we are ashamed and want to fix it asap! But before fixing a bug we need to reproduce and confirm it. In order to reproduce bugs we will systematically ask you to provide what we consider _minimal_ in order to try to reproduce it:

- version of React used
- version of React Native used
- version of this library that you are using
- 3rd-party libraries used, if any
- and most importantly - a use-case that fails
- If a code example/snippet is possible it is most welcomed

If there is any other information that you deem useful, please add it as well.

Having the information to reproduce the scenario, allows us to confirm the bug and then test that the solution actually fixes the problem.

We will be insisting on a minimal information to reproduce the scenario in order to save maintainers time and ultimately be able to fix more bugs. Interestingly.

Unfortunately we are not able to investigate / fix bugs without that minimal information, if the info is not provided and we don't hear back from you we are going to close your issue since don't have enough info to reproduce.

## You want to contribute some code?
